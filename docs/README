Your job for this benchmark is to write 4 test cases for the ArrayStack class using the ArrayStack Test Plan doc as your
template. When you complete the test plan SAVE IT AS A PDF!!!

Once your test plan ***PDF*** is completed, use the TestArrayStack file to implement those tests you planned out in the
test plan. I don't care what you call the tests as long as you're intentional with it and they follow the same general
format we've used in class.

When you open the TestArrayStack file, your import statements will start throwing an error. Hover your mouse over the red Junit
> Add Junit4 to classpath > don't change anything and just accept.

If your test file doesn't seem to be runnable, go to file > invalidate caches > don't change anything > invalidate and restart

If you need it, which you probably wont, but if you do, here's the wiki for Junit's assert
https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/assertions

Finally, make sure that your TestArrayStack compiles. We're half-way through the class now, I'm not going to accept code
that doesn't compile without a harsh penalty.

Submission:
1. Your completed test plan as a PDF
2. Your completed TestArrayStack file
